#  hplus_weights: Hoogle+'s statics module

## Pre-requisites
1. You will need the following directories created:
(a)  `~/research/data/inputs/hackage500`
(b) `~/research/data/inputs/hplusSupported`
(c) `~/research/data/working/hackage500`
(d) `~/research/data/working/hackage500Imports`
(e) `~/research/data/working/hackage500Maps`

It is an *urgent* goal to create a setup script that will ensure these are generated automatically. Perhaps through a Makefile
